<h2>Hey, I am Malabya Tewari</h2>
<p>I am a multidisciplinary software developer based out in Bangalore, India. I work as a Full Stack Developer & Technical Architect at
  <a href='http://valuebound.com'>Valuebound</a>
  where I wear a lot of hats. Mostly, I am mostly involved in Proof Of Concept projects. 
  But apart from that I also handle multiple Drupal projects and mentoring novice Drupaler.
  
</p>

<p>An active community member with contributions in the Drupal project and also in the Bangalore Drupal 
  community by organizing meetups, camps and provide Drupal training in Global Training Days.
</p>

<p>Often I am labeled as a workaholic, which is true to some extent, since there is so much learn and explore 
  around the web and it truly intrigues me. Since, you cannot achieve perfection, so you have to evolve.</p>
