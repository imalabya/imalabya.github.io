<h1>Hey, I am Malabya Tewari</h1>
I am a multidisciplinary software developer based out in Bangalore, India. I work as a Full Stack Developer & Technical Architect at [Valuebound](http://valuebound.com) where I find myself mostly working on Drupal projects, mentoring novice Drupaler and solving complex problems. Recently, getting my hands dirty with DevOps.

An active community member with contributions in the Drupal project and also in the Bangalore Drupal community by organizing meetups and and provide Drupal in a Day training.

My friends describe as a workaholic guy, which I am am, since  there is so much learn and explore around the web and it truly intrigues me. I like to evolve my working environment getting better day by day. Since, you cannot achieve perfection, so you have to evolve.

While not working, which is pretty rare, I am mostly fond of movies and series. Game of Thrones, Dexter and Prison Break being on top the list. Apart from that, I party a lot. Work hard party harder holds true for me
